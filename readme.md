## Flappy Bird on Console

I think best way to learning a new programming language is coding, especially doing it by recoding previous projects.

So, decided to create console flappy bird game again, but this time in Go.

* [**gocui**](https://github.com/jroimartin/gocui) was used for command line interfacing

    ```bash
    go get github.com/jroimartin/gocui
    go run flappy.go
    ```

### Keyboard Shortcuts
- **space**: up the bird
- **tab**: Exit
